# Spongebob Jump Game

Windows Form game written in C#. Platform type of game, you can collect coins and reach your goal of the door!

The game implemented some things that I was familiar with and it was fun to design the finished product. Object collision is making more 
sense and I loved finally using classic coins in one of my projects. I am not necessarily a fan of Spongebob but wanted to do something that
had a different color scheme than what I usually work with. I was not familiar with coin pickup before this game, I enjoyed that.

Bugs/Glitches
1) The player keeps vibrating. This occured at the stage of adding a platform Image into the game. Before the image of the platform was 
added, Spongebob was still. The issue seems to be border related as when they are not touching, it is okay. Once spongebob lands, it has 
difficulty.

Updates/Ways to Enhance
1) Block the ability to jump through the platforms, only around them.
